# Results

This folder contains exploratory analyses focused on **analyzing computed results** and their relationship with vehicle performance metrics.

## 📋 Objective

The main objective of this folder is to analyze and validate the final results produced by the pipeline, particularly:
- Understand the relationship between SOH and charging behavior
- Estimate real vehicle autonomy based on actual usage data
- Validate the accuracy of computed metrics against real-world observations

## 📂 Folder Structure

### `chargingspeed_soh.ipynb`
Analysis of the relationship between charging speed and State of Health (SOH).

### `real_autonomy.ipynb`
Computation and validation of real vehicle autonomy.
