    "# Soh estimation using vehicles charging data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "We want to estimate the soh of the watea batteries.  \n",
    "The vast majority of the electricity data lies in the charging periods.  \n",
    "Therefore we will base our solution on charging data but it could in theory be used on discharging periods.  \n",
    "### Vocabulary:\n",
    "- charging point: Aggregated time series samples over `CHARGING_POINTS_GRP_BY_SOC_QUANTIZATION` defined in `watea_constant`\n",
    "- `energy_added`: Energy received during a charging point.\n",
    "- `default_100_soh energy_added`: `energy_added` of a battery with 100% soh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "Our main assumption is that: *a battery that requires less energy to gain a certain amount of soc than another battery has a lower soh*.  \n",
    "Our second assumption is that: *The charges that were made at 3k odometer or less can be used to define the expected energy to gain a certain amount of soc for a 100% soh battery*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "1.  The required energy to gain a certain amount of soc depends on multiple factors*.  \n",
    "    **namely**:\n",
    "    - voltage/soc\n",
    "    - temperature\n",
    "    - current\n",
    "The relationship between the `energy_added` and the aforementioned factors is discontinous, forming different clusters of charging points.  \n",
    "We call these clusters charging regimes as they are most likely representative of different charger types/brands and regimes (AC/DC and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main idea:\n",
    "We estimate the soh of a charging points as its `energy_added` divided by the `default_100_soh energy_added`.\n",
    "The `default_100_soh energy_added` for a given charging point is estimated using Linear Regression.\n",
    "Note: Ideally there would do one regressor per charging regime but here we implement only one regressor for one charging regime."
