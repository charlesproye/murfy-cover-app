# SOH estimation improvement recap

## SOH estimation evaluation recap
The first thing to do to improve the estimation is to actually evaluate the estimation
### What we have done so far:
We have established a few ways to visualize:
-   The soh esitmation over as a 3d surface over two features.
-   The change in soh estimatoin with an arrow plot

We have proposed a simple way to programatically evaluate the estimation.  
We have propoesed a simple way to test this evaluation.   

### We have to do:
Unfortunatly time is not on our side.  
We need to test the evaluation method.

## SOH estimation improvement(with evaluation tools)
Once we can properly evaluate the estimation we can (hopefully) hyper tune our model and improve it.  

### What we have to do
Hyper tune the model, duh...
