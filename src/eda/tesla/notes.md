### Way of measuring improvements:
- SoH estimation residual to SoH Readout.
- SoH estimation monotonicity score per vehicle.
- SoH R2 score per vehicle

### Way of improving SoH estimation:
- Disantangle impact of heat management to the estimation (battery_heater_on, inside/outside temp diff).
- Search for some oscillation in the SoH
