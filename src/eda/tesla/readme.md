# Tesla EDA directory
## How is the directory organized?
- root: This is where the up to date notebooks that are used to implement steps in the pipeline are stored.
- ``data_cache``: This is the directory where the data is cached.
- ``legacy_soh_estimation``:  
    Instead of deleting the old SoH estimation notebooks, we keep them in this directory.  
    When moving a notebook into the legacy_soh_estimation directory, the reason for the deprecation *should* be documented in the notebook.
